# MED-ON-CHAIN

MED-ON-CHAIN is a web based Dapp that allows to store and transfer important assets, recordsd on IPFS instance. Ownership of files is securely recorded on the Ethereum blockchain making it the best platform to store assets


## Features

---> The store feature is a feature for uploading
files to IPFS which is both a create operation on the application
and write operation on the blockchain.

---> The ownership feature
can check the ownership of the uploaded file while allowing
users to be able to retrieve files that have been saved, this is an
implementation of read operations on the application and on
the blockchain. 

--> The transfer feature allows users to be able
to make ownership transfers of files that have been previously
stored, this illustrates the implementation of update operation on
the application and write operation on the blockchain.
